title: Hello Java!
summary: Sample Java application
description: |
  This project is my template for building and packaging Java
  applications. It uses Maven conventions for its directory structure
  and includes a sample application that prints "Hello World!" to
  standard output. It runs only as a console application from the
  Terminal with the command `hello-java`.

  For more information, including the source code and build
  files, see the README file for this project on GitHub
  (https://github.com/jgneff/hello-java).

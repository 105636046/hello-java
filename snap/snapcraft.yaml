title: Hello Java!
summary: Sample Java Swing and console applications
description: |
  This project is my template for building and packaging Java
  applications. It follows the conventions of Apache Maven for its
  directory structure and includes two sample applications that print
  "Hello World!" to standard output:

  - a Java console application with a command-line interface, and
  - a Java Swing application with a graphical user interface.

  For more information, including the source code and build files,
  see the README file for this project on GitHub:

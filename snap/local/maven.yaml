title: Hello Java!
summary: Sample Java applications
description: |
  This project is my template for building and packaging Java
  applications. It follows the conventions of Apache Maven for its
  directory structure and includes two sample applications that print
  "Hello World!" to standard output: a Java Swing application and a
  Java console application.

  For more information, including the source code and build files,
  see the README file for this project on GitHub:
